    "Nowadays, **recommender systems** are used to personalize your experience on the web, telling you what to buy, where to eat or even who you should be friends with. People's tastes vary, but generally follow patterns. People tend to like things that are similar to other things they like, and they tend to have similar taste as other people they are close with. Recommender systems try to capture these patterns to help predict what else you might like.\n",
    "E-commerce, social media, video and online news platforms have been actively deploying their own recommender systems to help their customers to choose products more efficiently, which serves win-win strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two most ubiquitous types of recommender systems are **Content-Based** and **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**. Collaborative filtering produces recommendations based on the knowledge of users’ attitude to items, that is it uses the \"wisdom of the crowd\" to recommend items. In contrast, content-based recommender systems focus on the attributes of the items and give you recommendations based on the similarity between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Collaborative filtering (CF) is the workhorse of recommender engines. The algorithm has a very interesting property of being able to do feature learning on its own, which means that it can start to learn for itself what features to use. CF can be divided into **Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering** and **Model-Based Collaborative filtering**. In this tutorial, you will implement Model-Based CF by using singular value decomposition (SVD) and Memory-Based CF by computing cosine similarity. \n",

It takes items and outputs other items as recommendations. \n",

Matrix factorization is widely used for recommender systems where it can deal better with scalability and sparsity than Memory-based CF. The goal of MF is to learn the latent preferences of users and the latent attributes of items from known ratings (learn features that describe the characteristics of ratings) to then predict the unknown ratings through the dot product of the latent features of users and items. \n",

By applying matrix factorization the model learns that important user features are _age group (under 10, 10-18, 18-30, 30-90)_, _location_ and _gender_, and for movie features it learns that _decade_, _director_ and _actor_ are most important. Now if you look into the information you have stored, there is no such feature as the _decade_, but the model can learn on its own. The important aspect is that the CF model only uses data (user_id, movie_id, rating) to learn the latent features. If there is little data available model-based CF model will predict poorly, since it will be more difficult to learn the latent features. \n",
